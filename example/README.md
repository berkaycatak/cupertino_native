# Cupertino Native Example

This is the demo app for the Cupertino Native package. It showcases all supported Liquid Glass widgets.

## Running the app

This app only shows the Liquid Glass components when running on iOS 26 or later. You must also build it with Xcode 26 or later. To activate the Xcode 26 beta, run the following command (provided it is installed in your Applications directory).

```bash
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode-beta.app
```

Then run it like any other Flutter app. It works on both the iOS Simulator and real devices.

```bash
cd example
flutter run
```
